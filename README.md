a Pixelworlds Gem calculating site
This is a re-vamp of the previous version of the website. this time it uses bootstrap css and jquery to make the site better and smoother.
Furthermore it uses material icons to improve the look of the site.

Please don't steal any of the files here. I worked hard and many hours to create this project and keep it free for all players :)
